                Invention of the Internet
            </h1>
            <p>
                With the development of ARPANET, or the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network, the first workable version of the Internet came in the late 1960s. The U.S. ARPANET used packet switching to allow several computers to communicate on a single network.
            </p>
            <p>
                After researchers Robert Kahn and Vinton Cerf developed the Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol, or TCP/IP, a communication model that sets guidelines for how data can be transmitted across different networks, the technology continued to evolve in the 1970s.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1990, when computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web, the online world then took on a more recognisable form. Although the internet itself is frequently misunderstood, the web is in fact only the most common means of accessing online data in the form of websites and hyperlinks.
            </p>
            <h1>
                Browser Wars
            </h1>
            <p>
                The world wide web before mainstream browsers were invented was mainly used by scientists and qualified individuals. It was not as easy to use as it is today and did require much more knowledge to use.
            </p>
            <p>
                Marc Andreessen along with a few other people decided to try to make the world wide web a more easy to use and intuitive tool so that everyone in the world could use it without too much difficulty. Andreessen came up with the worlds first graphical web browser called Mosaic that was basic point and click.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order for Andreessen's creation to progress it needed a large amount of money and this is where Jim Clark lent a hand.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bill Gates thought that people should pay in order to access this tool.
            </p>
            <p>
                Microsoft had left a lot of companies in its trail including even IBM.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is where Andreessen and Clark's company stepped in, a company called Netscape. Netscape released there new web browser called Navigator. Navigator was and instant success from the second it was released.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bill Gates then realized that this was the future. He told his company that they would need match and beat Netscape.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bill Gates and Microsoft made and offer to Netscape stating, they would buy their company for one millions dollars and if they didn't accept they would just copy everything Netscape did.
            </p>
            <p>
                Andressen made his hate of Microsoft public which was the one cardinal rule, not to insult the giant in the industry. He stated that windows would be irrelavent.
            </p>
            <p>
                Microsoft then came out with their own browser called Internet Explorer. The whole company's focus was to drive Netscape out of business.
            </p>
            <p>
                Microsoft had a lot of power due to them being an already established company with tons of money to spend. On top of that they had the software that these browsers would run on called Windows OS. Slowly Internet Explorers market share grew because it was free and bundled with windows OS. Netscape had to charge people to use their browser.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eventually, Netscape's market share went to single digits and the company was aquired by AOL.
            </p>
            <P>
                The US government came down hard on Microsoft stating they used their monopoly of the software market to drive Netscape out of business. The court eventually ruled to split the compnay and that order was later taken back. Gates later stepped down as CEO of Microsoft.
            </P>
            <p>
                Later search engines began to gain popularity. Software companies like Google began to really change the way the internet was used.
